    "# Lab Assignment 8\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "In this assignment, your goal is to build a classification model for the CIFAR-10 dataset using AlexNet architecture. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. You are required to implement the solution using PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "Learn how to preprocess and load data using PyTorch utilities. Understand the implementation of AlexNet for image classification. Train the model on the CIFAR-10 dataset and evaluate its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints to Solve the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "### Framework\n",
    "Use PyTorch to implement the solution. PyTorch provides modules for handling datasets, building neural network models, and training them efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing\n",
    "Since AlexNet expects larger input dimensions (224x224), you will need to resize the CIFAR-10 images. Apply the following transformations:\n",
    "* Resize to 256x256.\n",
    "* Perform center cropping to 224x224.\n",
    "* Normalize the image data using mean `[0.485, 0.456, 0.406]` and standard deviation `[0.229, 0.224, 0.225]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Architecture\n",
    "Use PyTorch’s prebuilt AlexNet model (`torchvision.models.alexnet`). Modify the final fully connected layers in the classifier to match the 10 output classes of the CIFAR-10 dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Loop\n",
    "* Use `torch.optim.SGD` for the optimizer with learning rate 0.001 and momentum 0.9.\n",
    "* Use `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss` for the loss function.\n",
    "* Train the model over multiple epochs.\n",
    "* Use `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` to load training and testing datasets in mini-batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation:\n",
    "* After training, evaluate the model on the test set and calculate the accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pseudocode for the Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "* Import Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prepare Dataset\n",
    "  * Download CIFAR-10 dataset.\n",
    "  * Apply transformations (resize, crop, normalize).\n",
    "  * Use `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` for batching and shuffling.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load Pretrained AlexNet\n",
    "  * Use torchvision.models.alexnet(pretrained=True).\n",
    "  * Modify the classifier to have 10 output classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Set Up Training\n",
    "  * Define the loss function (torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss).\n",
    "  * Set up the optimizer (torch.optim.SGD).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Training Loop\n",
    "  * For each epoch:\n",
    "    * Loop over mini-batches of the dataset.\n",
    "    * Move inputs and labels to the device (CPU/GPU).\n",
    "    * Perform forward pass, calculate loss, and backpropagate.\n",
    "    * Update weights using the optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Evaluate the Model\n",
    "  * Calculate accuracy on the test dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints on Specific PyTorch Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Loading:\n",
    "  * Use `torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10` for dataset loading and `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` for creating data loaders.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Preprocessing Transformations:\n",
    "  * Use `torchvision.transforms` for image resizing, cropping, and normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Model Architecture:\n",
    "  * Use `torchvision.models.alexnet(pretrained=True)` to load the AlexNet model and modify the classifier for CIFAR-10.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Training Utilities:\n",
    "  * `torch.optim.SGD` for optimization.\n",
    "  * `torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss` for the loss function.\n",
    "  * `model.to(device)` to move the model to GPU if available.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Evaluation Metrics:\n",
    "  * Calculate accuracy by comparing predicted labels with true labels.\n"
